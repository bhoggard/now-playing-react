## now-playing-web

React application which retrieves data from [now-playing-api](https://github.com/bhoggard/now-playing-api-ex) to display what's playing on my favorite streaming stations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
